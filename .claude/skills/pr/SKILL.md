# PR Creation Skill

Create a Pull Request from the commits on the current branch.
**The PR template is the top priority** — the body must follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` exactly.

## Steps

1. Check the current branch. If on `main`/`develop`, a PR cannot be created — tell the user and offer to create a branch (named `type/short-kebab-description`, e.g. `feat/login-form`).
2. Determine the base branch: `develop` if it exists on the remote, otherwise `main`.
3. Understand the **full branch diff** (not just the latest commit) via `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` and `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat`.
4. **Read `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` first** — always base the body on the current template file, never on a memorized copy (the template may have changed). If the file doesn't exist, use the section structure below.
5. If a push is needed, **ask the user first**. Never push without consent.
6. Create the PR with `gh pr create`. Title follows the commit convention: `type: 짧은 한글 설명`.

## PR Body Rules

Write the body in **Korean**, keeping the template's structure, headings, and emoji exactly as-is:

- `## 💡 배경 및 개요` — problem context and why this PR exists. Keep the `Resolves: #이슈번호` line with the real issue number (remove the line if there's no issue). For UI work, ask the user to attach screenshots/videos.
- `## 📃 작업내용` — what was done in this PR, as concrete bullets.
- `## 🙋‍♂️ 리뷰노트` — design decisions, trade-offs, open questions, and spots that deserve focused review.
- `## ✅ PR 체크리스트` — keep the checklist items. Check (`[x]`) only items actually verified; leave unverified items unchecked and mention why in 리뷰노트. Add extra project-specific checks when relevant.
- `## 🎸 기타` — anything that doesn't fit above; delete the section if empty.

Additional rules:

- Do not add, rename, or reorder sections. Do not leave the template's placeholder/guide text (`> ...`, `#{이슈번호}`) in the final body.
- Append at the end of the body: `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`

## Cautions

- Before creating the PR, verify locally: `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:ci`.
- Share the PR URL with the user after creation.
