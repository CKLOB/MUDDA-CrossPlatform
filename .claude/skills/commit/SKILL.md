# Commit Skill

Commit the current working-tree changes following the project convention.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand all changes.
2. Group changes into **logical units**. If unrelated concerns are mixed (e.g. a feature plus config changes), split them into separate commits.
3. For each unit, `git add` only the relevant files, then commit.

## Commit Message Format

```
type: 짧은 한글 설명
```

- A single short subject line only, **written in Korean** — no body, no trailers (no Co-Authored-By).
- End with a noun form (e.g. "~추가", "~수정", "~구성").
- Types:
  - `feat` — new feature
  - `fix` — bug fix
  - `refactor` — restructuring without behavior change
  - `style` — formatting, styling
  - `test` — add/update tests
  - `docs` — documentation
  - `ci` — CI/CD configuration
  - `chore` — build, tooling, misc configuration

Examples:

- `feat: 로그인 폼 추가`
- `fix: CI 액션 버전 최신화`
- `test: Jest 테스트 환경 구성`

## Cautions

- If the pre-commit hook (lint-staged) or commit-msg hook (commitlint) fails, fix the cause and commit again. Never bypass with `--no-verify`.
- Before committing code changes, verify with `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test:ci`.
- **Never push.** Only push when the user explicitly asks.
- If about to commit feature work on the `main`/`develop` branch, ask the user first whether to create a branch (named `type/short-kebab-description`, e.g. `feat/login-form`).
